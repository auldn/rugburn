- Open Rstudio
- Press Run App (upper right hand side of the top/left window in Rstudio) to run the app
	- once it starts to run, it'll change to saying Reload App
- if there is an error, do the following:
	- Stop the app: there is a red Stop sign on the Console window in Rstudio. Console is either under or to the right of the code window; it's where you'll see all the updates and hackerman looking things as the app runs
	- window with the app should disappear
	- the button on the top should now say Run App
	- run it again

- Input file contains the log2 fold change of each gene (thanks Shunji for the information)

Example: YFG = your favorite gene

gene	value
YFG	1.2
YFG	1.3
YFG	0.8
YFG	1.5

^ This would be all four of the YFG-targeted guides and each value is the log2 fold change (in reads corresponding to that cell population) for that specific guide. The guides are not in any specific order.
